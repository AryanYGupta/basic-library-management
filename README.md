# basic-library-management
I've created a Basic Library Management System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Later hosted on Amazon Web Services. All the required files are attached down here.
Make some changes according to your requirements and you are good to go.

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NOT ENTIRELY MINE, I HAVE BUILD THIS USING HELP FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.
